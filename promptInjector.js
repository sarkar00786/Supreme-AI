// scripts/promptInjector.js
// This script is intended to contain logic for injecting prompts into the Gemini UI.
// Currently, the core injection logic is handled directly in content.js
// by calling functions from gemini-chat.js. This file serves as a placeholder
// for more complex or modular injection strategies if needed in the future.

console.log('Aura AI: promptInjector.js loaded.');

// No direct functions defined here currently, as content.js will manage the calls.
// If you build more complex prompt injection features (e.g., inserting into specific
// parts of a rich text editor), you might define them here.
